So I was looking for something to rename my episode files to something which includes, season number, episode number (the easier part), and the episode name as per the databases (like anidb), and this was the tough part. Existing solutions were there, like shokoanime and anidb renaming utils. But they first calculate complete hash of the file then match it with the hashes in the database and rename the file based on that. Sure, it will have better renaming, but for me the drawback was the time it took to process (and maybe CPU usage). 
So, since I absolutely know the anime season and name, why hash the files? 
Can't we just fetch the episode names and rename them. And so I did that, made a python script (in form of a jupyter notebook) it asks for 4 things: 
1. path to directory where your files are
2. anime name
3. anime season
4. anidb anime ID
And then it renames the video files as you want them, it can include the episode names as well. You can change the format string to your liking. 

## You can use either the jupyter notebook, or the python script (.py file, it also asks for user input.)
