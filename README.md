# gmeet-schedule-automater
This python script automatically joins/disconnects google meet meetings according to a set schedule provided.

INTRODUCTION

This is a small script i made to skip sitting in front of my laptop to join and rejoin every other online lecture of my college (if i want to attend that is).

It can be used by anyone who wants to make better use of their time :)

It's written in python, and separately need 4 things to work properly:
1. Selenium webdriver for Google Chrome.
2. Selenium library for python.
3. A copy of your google chrome profile, stored somewhere else instead of original location.
4. A CSV file in the mentioned format, including meeting's start time, end time, and link.
